# ARPGG
Working on an Action-RPG Game in Java, somewhat inspired by games like Diablo and Path of Exile, but with top-down graphics similar to games like Pok√©mon Red.

## About the project
With Diablo IV and Path of Exile II around the corner, I got really inspired by the sort of gameplay, and wanted to give my own take on the genre.

It won't be isometric like those two games, and it will be rendered using Software rather than Hardware thus my choice to use Java.

## Contributions
I won't really accept pull requests right now, while they are helpful, I mostly try to learn from writing solutions myself.
However feel free to create an issues about possible problems, and I might take a look. As for development itself, it's meant to be a solo project for now.

## Name
Name itself isn't yet determined, thus why the repository is just called ARPGGame. When a name is determined, I will rename the repository and the project itself, so if your bookmark is invalid, that's probably why.

## Download
If you want a copy of the game, just clone the repository, open the project in IntelliJ and build the existing artifact. The game jar should appear as ``out/artifacts/ARpgG/ARpgG.jar``.

Alternatively, you can check the Releases tab, which will occasionally get updated with new versions when the code is deemed stable enough and major changes has been made.
